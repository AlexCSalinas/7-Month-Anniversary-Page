This was a cute easy webpage I made for my girlfriend as a gift for our 7 month dating anniversary. 

It includes the following:
- A countdown to our 1 year anniversary
- A quiz about our relationship
- A cute sliding bar that asks "How much do you love me?"
  - And a different sliding bar that appears with a longer length when the original bar is slid to the max titles "Why not this much"
- A version of the NYT connections game based on our relationship.
